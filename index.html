  			<h3><br>My Work</h3>
	      <p><a href="https://github.com/chloebecker">Here is the link to my GitHub profile </a>and below is a little bit about the projects I'm currently working on:</p><br>
	  		
	      	<h4>Women's Lacrosse Website</h4>
	      	<p>Since our team is new, I thought having an online presence would help spread awareness about our games, fundraising, etc. I'm utilizing Jekyll and wokring on implementing some JavaScript that can communicate with our database. You can see its beginning stages <a href="https://chloebecker.github.io/seu-w-lacrosse/">here.</a></p><br>

		    <h4>Travel Blog</h4>
		    <p>I built a simple travel blog using Jekyll so my family and close friends could keep up with my adventures. You can see it <a href="https://chloebecker.github.io/blog/">here</a>!</p><br>

		    <h4>ToDo List App</h4>
		    <p>Despite being the most frustrating project I've worked on, the to-do list app I'm building for iOS is teaching me a lot about how to store data both on devices and in various databases as well as how to debug with Swift in XCode. My goals for this project are to be able to store to-do list data in a database and add a feature that allows users to create a schedule in which they can plan when to do certain tasks based on events that occur during their day (classes, work, etc.). <br><br> I wanted to build this app to make time management easier for myself. I like to write everything I have to do down however, since schedules often change I have to rewrite my daily/weekly plan several times. With this app I'll be able to just drag and drop to reorder my schedule.</p>

	      <p>Hi there! I'm currently a third-year Computer Science student at St. Edward's University. My interests include AI, web development, playing lacrosse, and learning French. This past summer I recieved a scholarship to study in Angers, France at a month-long intensive French language program. I currently work in the Office of IT at St. Edward's University and am the founder and 2-year acting president of our Women's Club Lacrosse Team. Go goats! <br><br>I'm currently learning JavaScript and am excited to implement it into my school's women's lacrosse website. Other languages I'm interested in learning are Ruby and Prolog.</p>
